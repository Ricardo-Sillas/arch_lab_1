Project 1: Tokenizer.c
======================
For this project, we were assigned to create a file that would basically do
the same thing as what a split function would do. I ended up testing this by
having a fgets method, and put in strings and tested it like that.

Project 2. History.c
====================
For this project, we were assigned to create a linked list and to have
everything that was inputted be saved inside the linked list and assign every
history with an id. We were also supposed to create a method to clear the
linked list. I tested this by having creating a couple of nodes, adding them
to the linked list, printed out the list with its id, run it through the free
method, and printed the linked list again.

Project 3. Interface.c
======================
This was the final project, we were supposed to use both history.c and
tokenizer.c for this project. We were supposed to have the user to either
input a string, look at the history, and let them choose a history that they
wanted. I ended up testing this out by actually running the code and seeing if
there were any bugs in it.
